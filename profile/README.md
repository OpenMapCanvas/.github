## 🏞️ Dual Canvas Experience

To cater to every community, creator, and artist, OpenMapCanvas offers **two unique places**:

### 1. **Free Place**

- **Open Creativity:** No strict rules—paint, erase, or remix anything!
- **Dynamic Interaction:** "Voids" and art destruction allowed, fostering spontaneous, ever-changing art.
- **Competitive and Fun:** Expect wild events, temporary creations, and a fast-paced, playful environment.

### 2. **Strict Place**

- **Respectful Collaboration:** Enforced guidelines to ensure lasting artworks and fair play.
- **No Griefing:** Destruction or abuse of others' art is not permitted.
- **Controlled Void:** Erasing pixels ("void") is allowed only in ocean areas, and only if it does not harm existing art.
- **Ideal for Projects:** Build murals, long-term artworks, and organized collaborations without fear of disruption.

## 🔥 Ambitions & Values

- **Community-Driven:** Ideas, rules, and features are forged by contributors and users. Your voice matters.
- **Inclusive & Welcoming:** Creators, developers, organizers, and newcomers all have a space.
