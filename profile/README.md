## 🖼️ Server Structure

OpenMapCanvas supports **both public and private servers**, allowing diverse usage scenarios—from large global canvases to smaller community or event-specific spaces.

### Official Main Servers Hosted by OpenMapCanvas Team:

- **Strict Place**  
  - Enforced rules to foster respectful collaboration and lasting artworks.
  - No griefing allowed.
  - Void (pixel erasing) only allowed in ocean areas without damaging art.
  - Ideal for structured projects and long-term creations.

- **Free Place**  
  - Open creativity with minimal restrictions.
  - Allows voids and pixel destruction, encouraging dynamic and spontaneous creations.
  - Wild, fast-evolving environment inspired by the original r/place.
