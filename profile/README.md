# OpenMapCanvas

We're building an open source pixel art platform inspired by r/place and wplace, but actually ready to handle users without dying.

## What's the idea?

So you know r/place? That was cool. And wplace exists but it's kinda struggling with all the users it's getting. We want to make something that actually scales properly - multiple servers, moderation that works, infrastructure that won't crash when people show up.

Draw pixel art on world maps or custom canvases with friends or the whole internet, your choice.

## Server Ideas

**Official Servers** (we'd host):
- **Strict Place** - No griefing, organized art projects, stuff that actually stays
- **Free Place** - Pure chaos mode, destroy whatever, classic vibes

*(thinking about rank-locked servers later to keep trolls out and make our lives easier)*

**Community Servers** - Like how TF2 or GTA (FiveM) has community servers, but for pixel art. Host your own with whatever rules you want.

## What we're thinking

- **Multiple servers** - Join official ones or spin up your own
- **Plugin system** - Minecraft server style. Want to draw on a Minecraft world instead of Earth? Someone will make a plugin for that
- **Private servers** - Just you and your crew  
- **Rank system** - VRChat-style trust levels, better players get access to nicer servers
- **Actually working moderation** - Report buttons and admin tools that don't suck
- **Self-hosting ready** - Docker + scripts so anyone can run their own
- **Proper backend** - Load balancing, sharding, all that boring stuff so it doesn't die

## Where we're at

This is all just ideas brewing right now. Planning to start actually coding in September, currently just throwing ideas around on Discord.
